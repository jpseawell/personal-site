  # Turning Ideas into Usable Products

  I'm Justin Seawell, a full-stack engineer who likes to turn rough ideas into real products. Recent work includes a friend-powered iOS app for making music, a WebGL engine that grows 3D worlds in the browser, and an online hotel check-in flow that serves millions of guests. Different projects, same motive: build tools people actually enjoy.

  My process is straightforward. I talk with the people who will use or maintain the software, map a clear plan, and iterate until the experience feels obvious. Good code should fade into the background so users can focus on their own goals, not the interface in front of them.

  When I'm away from the keyboard I'm usually with my wife and toddler, layering tracks in Logic Pro, or firing up the grill. Whether it's music, cooking, or software, I get the same satisfaction from tweaking details until everything clicks.
